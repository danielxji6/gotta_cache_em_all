**Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:**

* **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements?

* [x] PostgreSQL: Use PostgreSQL for your database in development and production.
* [x] Data Models Include at least two data models with associations.
* [x] Data Validation: Your application should validate incoming data before entering it into the database.
* [x] Error Handling: Forms in your application should also validate data, handle incorrect inputs, and provide user feedback on the client side.
* [x] Testing Write specs for 25% of your controller functionality, as well as for any model methods.
* [x] Views: Use partials to follow DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) development in your views.
* [x] Home & About Pages: Create a landing page (homepage) that clearly explains your app's value proposition and guides the user through the "get started" funnel. Crete an about page that includes photos and brief bios of your team members.
* [x] User Experience: Ensure a pleasing and logical user experience. Use a framework like Bootstrap to enhance and ease your CSS styling.
* [x] JavaScript & jQuery: Add dynamic client-side behavior with event-driven functionality.
* [x] Responsive Design: Make sure your app looks great on a phone or tablet.
Heroku: Deploy your app to Heroku. Ensure no app secrets are exposed. Do not commit secret keys to GitHub!


* **Creativity**: Did you add a personal spin or creative element to your project? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

Pokemon is a beloved gaming franchise that own the card collecting and video gaming industry. You have taken your passion and ran with it to create a fun  twist on the classic game. Good job!  

* **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

Your code was well thought out and intentional with minimal spaghetti and repetition. Some slight refactoring would benefit your app greatly.  Adhering to the skinny controller and fat model policy would make your product shine.

* **Problem Solving**: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

It was evident that you solved problems in a methodical and progressive manner. In the development process you have created robust and proud code.  Great work!
